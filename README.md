# Oui

> [![experimental](http://hughsk.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/hughsk/stability-badges)
This is all still pretty experimental. The api is likely to change without support. You have been warned!

Oui is a stupidly simple way to instrument code and control a program.
Pass it some data an oui renders a set of controllers that allow you to
visualise, control and shape your program. Objects go in and UI's come out.

## 5 second demo

`npm install @marklundin/oui`

Create an object, add some properties
```javascript
import oui from 'oui'

let api = {
  numeric : 10,
  stringy : "It's a string!",
  bool: false
}

oui( api )
```

And hey presto...

## Why?

Devtools are great, but sometime you want to reach into your code and manipulate
it at run time. This is often the case for programs that have some time component,
such as animations or games.

Oui provides a declarative way to do this. You pass it an object, and Oui
creates an appropriate UI. Numbers turn into sliders, strings make text boxes and
booleans make checkboxes. You define a nice clean api for you application and
Oui lets you play with the parameters to shape the output.


### sliders are boring...

The basic set of controllers cover many simple scenarios, but often your data
describes something more complicated such as rotations, colors, or a periodic function.
For those situations, there's an additional set of controllers such as [color pickers](http://marklundin.github.io/core-controllers/documentation/#ColorPicker) [xy pads](http://marklundin.github.io/core-controllers/documentation/#XYPad), [graphs](http://marklundin.github.io/core-controllers/documentation/#Graph) and more.
You simply annotate a property with a type controller.

Check the [core controllers documentation](http://marklundin.github.io/core-controllers/documentation)
for the full list.

### rolling your own

Of course, if these controllers don't quite cut it though you can always roll your own. You
want a vertical slider instead, or something more complex like a 3D rotation control.
Just create your component, import it, and tag the property with it.

Follow the guide to [rolling you're own controller](/docs/custom_controllers).


### What about constraints?
Tagging properties is not just useful for choosing different controllers, it's
also a way to declare additional information about a property. You can for example,
specify the minimum and maximum range for a number, or provide some useful description
of what the property actually does. These help controllers understand how to display
and update the property.

Here's an example of how you'd constrain a number to within 3 and 100.

```javascript
draw({
  @annotate({ min:3, max: 100, desc:'This property is very, very interesting' })
  numeric: 5
})
```

This is useful for passing information about a property to a controller. Think of
it as a way to declare metadata about a property. Not only does it inform the controllers, but
it makes your code eay to understand.


### What on earth is @annotate?
@annotate is a decorator. It's part of the [es7 specification](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators),
and yes it's still only a proposal. Having said that, decorators are just syntactic sugar,
you can still do the same thing in es5 land with the admittedly awkward `annotate({ min:3, max: 100 })( obj, 'num' )`
If, however you want to go all es7, drop `babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy`
or similar in your transform pipeline.


### FAQ


#### OK, but why React?
It's true there are a number of great reactive libraries to choose from. deku, vue, mithril, riot. All of these are great, and many. The list goes on. I chose React because it's a well supported product and it's unlikely that it will stagnate. I don't want to be dealing with a dead dependancy next year.


#### What about panels?

On anything larger than a demo, you'll more then likely be working with other people, and they'll probably
want their own UI to test. Oui encourages you to surface parts of your code as an api, but this isn't always
practical when prototyping. This is where panels come in.

Panels are a way to create distinct UI elements. They're effectively sub sections of the UI display.

Here's how you'd do that.

```
import panel from 'oui/panel'

let opts = { title:"A title", }
let oui = panel( opts ) // Creates a namespace. A unique panel
let obs = oui.once({num: 10}) // Renders api, returns an observable or similar
let obs = oui({num: 10}) // Continuous render. Watches api for changes

// Methods
oui.destroy()

```

Oh, and we :heart dat.gui
